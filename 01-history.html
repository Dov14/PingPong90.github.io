    <p>Nielsen, Zehe & Antas, P.C. was founded in 1997, when its founding partners left a large Chicago based litigation firm. Since that time, the firm has steadily grown to a group of diverse attorneys with a reputation for providing high-quality, cost-effective, innovative legal services throughout the United States. Our clients are local, national and international corporations, insurance companies and individuals.</p>
    <p>The firm's attorneys have substantial litigation experience. Our attorneys have resolved thousands of cases for our clients, via arbitration and mediation, whenever possible. However, when necessary, our attorneys are experienced trial lawyers, many of whom have won verdicts in excess of $1 million, and who have defended substantial claims. Our attorneys are known as aggressive courtroom advocates. Seven of our attorneys are former State's Attorneys, having tried hundreds of jury and bench trials. We invite you to review the experience of our firm's attorneys in the <a href="http://www.nettech.com/404.html">Attorney Profile</a> section.</p>
    <p>Our firm has grown steadily and our success and growth can be attributed to our commitment to finding creative solutions to our clients' legal problems, whether by settlement, litigation or the use of alternative dispute resolution. We emphasize proactive, not reactive, strategies to achieve this commitment.<p><br />
    <p>Nielsen, Zehe & Antas, P.C. is committed to providing the highest standard of service and integrity. Today, the firm includes more than 19 lawyers who have the experience, maturity, and legal skills to handle a wide range of legal problems. Each member of the firm pledges prompt, effective legal representation for each and every client. We are proud of our strong commitment to integrity and excellence in the practice of law as well as serving our community.</p>
